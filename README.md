## üìï About

**Animal Navigation App** is a fictional iOS app designed to advise the risk of some species suffer extinction by human acts, and its main purpose is to practice navigation in screens. The app features some screens showing details of some animals in risk of extinction. That was developed using UIKit, Auto Layout, protocols and navigation methods as Modal and navigation controller. During the development process, I focused on creating an intuitive user interface and use color theory to make it smoother to the user and provida a seamless user experience. I also faced several challenges, such as ensuring that the app was responsive across different screen sizes and optimizing the app‚Äôs performance. Also faced others as using protocols to interact with user inputs as delegate protocol and learned to use Modal Navigation to show information to user and Navigation Controller to create a clean and optimized nagivation between screens.

 In sum, I really enjoyed working in this app, was a great experience to increase my habilities in IOS development and learned a lot about navigation in IOS app development.
