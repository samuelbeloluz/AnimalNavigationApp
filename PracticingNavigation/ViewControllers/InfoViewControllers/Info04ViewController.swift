The Maned Wolf is neither a fox nor a wolf, despite its markings resembling those of foxes. The Maned Wolfâ€™s habitat, the Cerrado, is rapidly shrinking. This poses significant challenges to its life cycle and breeding habits, making its conservation status precarious.\n According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, it is listed as near threatened. However, the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources considers it a vulnerable species.\n In some regions, the situation is even more critical. For instance, in Rio Grande do Sul, the Maned Wolf is considered critically endangered."
